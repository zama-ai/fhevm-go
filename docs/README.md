**fhevm-go** is an open-source library used to easily integrate the [fhEVM](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm) into an EVM-compatible blockchain.


## Main features

fhevm-go gives your EVM the ability to compute on encrypted data using fully homomorphic encryption by:
- a collection of operations on encrypted data via precompiled contracts
- various additional EVM components that support encrypted computation

## Target users

The library helps EVM maintainers to extend their EVM with the power of FHE. If you are looking for a library to deploy and use smart contracts on an fhEVM, you should better look at [fhevm](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm)
